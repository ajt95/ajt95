My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I am Allison Thirion Blasius, MPH, RD, LD, FAND, a registered dietitian and doctoral student.\nI have been a Registered Dietitian since 2018 and have practiced in a variety of pediatric settings, including eating disorders, neurology, surgery, pulmonolgy, general outpatient counseling, school nutrition. Currently, I practice at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital and sub-specailize in both pediatric endocrinology and pediatric kidney disease. I also work with Camp Ho Mita Koda, the nation’s oldest camp for children with type 1 diabetes.\nMy research interests center around nutritional quality of life in children, especially those with chronic conditions like type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal disease. I am also interested in the impact that public health nutrition programs like the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) have on childhood health outcomes and how policies dictating these programs can be optimized to promote the long-term health of all children. Currently, I work under the mentorship of Dr. Melissa Prescott on a variety of projects regarding diet quality, nutrition education, and NLSP policy.\nWhile I enjoy research, education is my passion. I have been an adjunct lecturer at Case Western Reserve University since 2023, where I teach introductory nutrition courses at the undergraduate level. I also support the UH Dietetic Internship as part of my clinical role and have precepted over 75 students since becoming an RD.\nAlmost everything you need to know about me professionally can be found on my CV.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
